	<p><br /><br />	<center>The college aims to provide quality education on egalitarian basis to all segments of the society on merit and competition. It is our firm conviction that education is an all-embracing activity, encompassing all aspects from class-room to play-fields, from play-fields to pen and from pen to rostrum to produce good citizens and leaders. We have endeavored to create congenial atmosphere and conducive environment, enabling the cadets to grow and flourish and to develop their potentials and talents to become the future leaders of the country. There is a triangle of education consisting of academics, curricular and co-curricular activities, laying special emphasis on character building.
<br /><br/>The College has its own distinct name and fame, glorious achievements at both the national and international scene. Its eventful history of more than three decades is replete with meritorious traditions of excellence in all domains of educational activities. Our cadets have touched high watermarks by amassing trophies after trophies in debates and  declamation contests held on all Pakistan basis, clinching solitarian honours in Asian Arts Competition, proving their mettle by standing first in all Pakistan Essay Writing Competition, and also clinching the honour at an International level.

 PRINCIPAL'S COMMITMENT
<br /><br />
My aim as Principal is to ensure quality education, i.e. education in wider sense encompassing literary, cultural, co-curricular and extracurricular activities with particular emphasis on character and discipline. I would like the Cadets to excel in academics, sports, debates and declamations, clubs and societies but also to be aware of their religious obligations and social norms. I am committed to the development of their personality and character, so that they emerge as better students, human beings and enlightened individuals prepared to face the challenges that lie ahead and share the burden of their parents and their family, rather being a burden on them or on the society.

 
<br /><br />
To achieve the aim that I have initiated, healthy environment and congenial atmosphere are essential pre-requisites, particularly in institutions like ours, where schedules are regulated and life is a drab. Though our resources are limited, I will Inshallah find the solutions to the problems that have been identified. 

 <br /><br />
            I would like to share my vision of a Cadet. In nutshell I expect a Cadet should:
 
<br /><br />
Have a sense of honour and integrity.
 Be honest and sincere in pursuit of his goals.
Be respectful to his elders.
Display moral and physical courage.
Be organised and disciplined.
Be cheerful and proud of his person and the institution.
Have esprit de corps.
 
<br /><br />
            I urge the cadets and faculty to work hard and to maintain the glorious traditions.
